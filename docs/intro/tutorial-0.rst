Getting Started
===============

Getting a working local copy of Batavia requires a few steps: getting a copy of
the Batavia code, and the ouroboros dependency within a virtual environment.

You'll need to have Python 3.4 available for Batavia to work. Instructions on
how to set this up are `on our Environment setup guide
<http://pybee.org/contributing/first-time/setup/>`_.

1. Setup a `tutorial` folder to store everything::

   $ mkdir tutorial
   $ cd tutorial

2. Get a copy of the Batavia code by running a :code:`git clone`::

   $ git clone https://github.com/pybee/batavia

3. We'll need to create a virtual environment, and install Batavia into it.

 * For Linux, MacOS::

   $ virtualenv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   $ cd batavia
   $ pip install -e .

 * For Windows::

   > virtualenv --python=c:\python34\python.exe venv
   > cd venv\Scripts
   > activate
   > pip install -e .

 * For Anaconda users::

   $ cd batavia
   $ conda create -n batavia
   $ source activate batavia
   $ pip install -e .

4. In addition, you need to install `Node.js`_. You need to have a recent version
   of Node; we test using v6.9.1. Once you've installed node, you can use it to
   install Batavia's Javascript dependencies, and compile the Batavia library::

   $ npm install
   
5. Lastly, compile the Batavia library and bundle itâ€™s dependencies::

   $ npm run build

Your final setup should end up looking like this::

  _ pybee
    \_ batavia
    \_ venv (if using virtualenv)

You now have a working Batavia environment!

Next, we can `setup the sandbox </intro/tutorial-1>`, and try out
running Python in your browser.
